# Getting Started

Luminar is not published to NPM and we don't plan to do it. However, you can install it using a tarball we generate for every release.

To install Luminar, run the command bellow:

```
npm install --save https://github.com/moductor/luminar/releases/download/<VERSION>/release.tar.gz
```

Don't forget to replace the text `<VERSION>` with a version tag. <strong>Current version: <code>v{version}</code></strong>
